This project implements a full machine learning pipeline to predict vehicle CO₂ emissions using Scikit-learn.

It includes:
- data cleaning,
- feature preprocessing (scaling and encoding),
- model training with Random Forest Regressor,
- performance evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE),
- and result visualization.

The final model is saved using Joblib for future use.
